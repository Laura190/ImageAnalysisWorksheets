# Further Resources

A good starting point for finding new tools or finding more training materials is the [Bioimage Informatics Index](https://biii.eu/)

See if you can find entries for:
1) Training materials for 3D image analysis
2) Other image analysis software e.g. QuPath or CellProfiler
3) An ImageJ plugin for deconvolution

# Example Data

Image repositories are a good place to find images for testing image analysis workflows. We have used some data from repositories in other worksheets. Here are a few others that are used for depositing published data:
1) [Image Data Repository (IDR)](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/)
2) [BioImage Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioimage-archive/galleries/galleries.html)
3) [ProteomeXchange](https://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/ui)
4) [EMPIAR](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/)

Choose one of the repositories and explore what type of data they accept.

# Version Control

As you start developing more complicated workflows you may want to start using version control software. [Git][https://git-scm.com/doc](version control software) and [Github](https://github.com/)(code repository) are commonly used for scientific software. You can sign up to [Github Education](https://github.com/education) to access additional tools and resources from Github.

# Making data FAIR

When you are ready to publish your results, you will need to make the data available to others. Ideally your data should fulfil the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). What does FAIR stand for? 

There is a series of [RDMBites on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyCNTVs-UBvuJF7WausQ5q7v7pI1vEpI1) explaining more about what metadata is required to make bioimage data FAIR.
