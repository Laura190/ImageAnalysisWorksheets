# Validation

After designing an image analysis workflow it is important to validate it, especially if you are planning to use the same process on multiple images. The validation strategies used will depend on the type of problem.

- Measurement
- Classification
- Segmentation

Your final workflow may contain some or all of these problems. In the following sections there are some examples of quantitative measurements that can be used to evaluate the performance for each problem. Regardless of the problem, it is necessary to have some **ground truth** data to compare your results to. The ground truth, or true value, should be evaluated independently from the image analysis pipeline. The method to acquire the ground truth may depend on the area of study. There is often a method that is considered the "gold standard" in the community. There are image data sets that are provided with ground truth data, such as some from the BBBC. These can be used for evaluating how well image analysis pipelines work. However, in most cases you will need to evaluate your own ground truth data to evaluate your image analysis pipeline. Often this involves **manually** counting or measuring something.

# Validation of a Measurement Problem

Aim: Estimate a scalar or vector quantity

Method: Calculate the mean relative error

$$ mean\ relative\ error = \frac{measured\ value - true\ value}{true\ value}$$

## üî¢ Comparison of cell count

The number of cells in AS_09125_050118150001_A03f00d0.tif were counted manually by two different human observers. The first person counted 350 cells and the second person counted 362 cells in this image. The mean of the manual counts is 531.

Automatically count the number of cells in AS_09125_050118150001_A03f00d0.tif using the ```Find Maxima...``` tool. Calculate the mean relative error between the count from ```Find Maxima...``` (measured value) and the mean manual count (true value).

The image and manual counts are from BBBC01.

# Validation of Classification Problem

Aim: Decide if something is present in an image

Method: Calculate the sensitivity and specificity

$$ Sensitivity = \frac{True\ Positives}{True\ Positives + False\ Negatives}$$

The fraction of present things that are correctly detected, 0 none detected to 1 all detected

$$ Specificity = \frac{True\ Negatives}{True\ Negatives + False\ Positives}$$

The fraction of correct detection when the thing is not present, 0 all falsely detected to 1 none falsely detected

## üóÇÔ∏è Classification of Dots

The dots in the Dot Blot sample image have been classified by an automated algorithm. The results have been compared to a manual classification by an expert in the field. The dots in orange squares are <span style="color: #ff9900;">True Positives</span>, the dots in the green squares are <span style="color: #00b913;">False Negatives</span>, the dots in magenta squares are <span style="color: #ff00e5;">False Positives</span> and the dots in teal squares are <span style="color: #00b99e;">True Negatives</span>. Calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the automated algorithm.

# Validation of Segmentation Problem

Aim: Estimate the boundary regions of an image

Method: Calculate the difference between the segmented and ground truth boundaries

$$ root\ mean\ square\ error = \sqrt{\frac{\sum^N_{i=1}\left(\mathbf{x^s_i}-\mathbf{x^g_i}\right)^2}{{N}}} $$

where $N$ is the number of points, $x^s_i$ are the points that make up the segmented boundary and $x^g_i$ are the points that make up the ground truth boundary. This is to calculate the root mean square error, but other metrics can also be used, e.g. Hausdorff distance

## üß© Segment graphene grains

Segment the large graphene grain (dark region) in graphite_image.tif. Use the rmse2Dselections.ijm macro to calculate the root mean square error between your segmentation and the ground truth segmentation in graphite_mask.tif. Take a look at the macro first to figure out how it works and what inputs you need to provide. If you are not sure, please ask.

The graphite data is from (nanoMFG)[https://github.com/nanoMFG/unet-sem/tree/master].

For more information on validation see Chapter 10 of Handbook of Medical Imaging, Volume 2. Medical Image Processing and Analysis (K. Bowyer, 2000).

# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that trains algorithms based on data. If you a dataset and have obtained the ground truth data using the "gold standard" method, you may be able train a machine learning algorithm. You will need **enough** data and associated ground truth data, however it is difficult to know how much data is enough. It is dependent on the complexity of the task to be accomplished, the quality of the data available and the required accuracy of the results. You may need tens of thousands of samples for some tasks, but hundreds of samples may be enough for simpler tasks. Evaluating the ground truth data is often a manual, user intensive process, so there is a balance to be found when deciding how much testing data to use.of samples. Assuming that you have enough training data and that is representative of the whole dataset, a portion of the data will be used to train the algorithm and a portion will be used for testing.

Machine learning algorithms are designed to find patterns in data. **Training** (supervised learning) takes a set of input data and it's known outputs and trains a model to predict the output for new data. Machine learning can be used to train classfication models, which separate input data into categories. It can also be used for denoising, isotropic reconstruction and surface projections (See (CSBDeep)[https://csbdeep.bioimagecomputing.com/] for examples). Training a model can be very time consuming, it can require a lot of user input and computing time. Using a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) rather than the Central Processing Unit (CPU) can speed up the processing time.

## Machine Learning for Pixel Classification

The (Trainable Weka Segmentation Fiji Plugin)[https://imagej.net/plugins/tws/] combines a collection of machine learning algorithms with selected image features to produce segmentations. Other software options include:
- (ilastik)[https://www.ilastik.org/index.html]
- (LabKit)[https://imagej.net/plugins/labkit/]
- (Paintera)[https://github.com/saalfeldlab/paintera]

Unzip the BBBC008_partial.zip folder. This is a subset of BBBC008 from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (the same dataset was used in the (Measuring, Stitching and Batch Processing Worksheet)[MeasuringStitchingAndBatchProcessing/MeasuringStitichingAndBatchProcessing.md])
